# Notification System Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive notification system implemented for the Amazon-Groupon application, covering all 6 scenarios (S1-S6) as requested.

## Overview

The notification system provides real-time notifications for various events in the group purchasing workflow, including join requests, group status changes, payments, deliveries, and deadline expirations.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **NotificationService** (`server/notificationService.ts`) - Core service handling all notification logic
2. **Database Integration** - Uses existing `sellerNotifications` table for both seller and user notifications
3. **Route Integration** - Integrated into existing API routes for seamless operation
4. **Cron Jobs** (`server/cronJobs.ts`) - For processing expired notifications

### Database Schema

The system uses the existing `sellerNotifications` table with the following structure:
- `id` - Primary key
- `seller_id` - User ID (for both sellers and regular users)
- `type` - Notification type (see types below)
- `title` - Notification title
- `message` - Notification message
- `data` - JSON data with additional context
- `is_read` - Read status
- `priority` - Priority level (low, normal, high, urgent)
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `read_at` - Read timestamp

## Notification Scenarios

### S1: User Request to Join Group

**Trigger**: When a user requests to join a group
**Recipients**: Group owner

- Priority: `normal`
- **Shipping Status Update**: Automatically updates to "Delivered"

### S5: Discount Timeline Expired

**Trigger**: When discount period ends
**Recipients**: All group participants
**Implementation**:

- Checks `offerValidTill` field on groups

**Notification Details**:
- Type: `discount_expired`
- Title: "Discount Period Ended ‚è∞"
- Message: Includes group name, product details, and urgency
- Priority: `high`

### S6: Payment Deadline Expired

**Trigger**: When payment deadline passes (7 days after discount expires)
**Recipients**: Users who haven't paid
**Implementation**:
- Processed via cron job (`/api/notifications/process-expired`)
- Identifies unpaid participants

**Notification Details**:
- Type: `payment_deadline_expired`
- Title: "Payment Deadline Passed ‚ö†Ô∏è"
- Message: Includes group context and next steps
- Priority: `urgent`

## API Endpoints

### Notification Management

- `GET /api/seller/notifications` - Get notifications for authenticated user
- `GET /api/seller/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread notification count
- `PATCH /api/seller/notifications/:id/read` - Mark notification as read
- `PATCH /api/seller/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all notifications as read
- `DELETE /api/seller/notifications/:id` - Delete notification

### Processing Expired Notifications

- `POST /api/notifications/process-expired` - Process expired notifications (S5 & S6)

### Testing

- `POST /api/seller/notifications/test` - Create test notification

## Shipping Status Tracking

The system automatically updates shipping status in the following scenarios:

1. **Payment Completed**: When payment is successful
2. **Delivered**: When order status is updated to "delivered"

Status values:
- `pending` - Initial status
- `Payment Completed` - After successful payment
- `processing` - Order being prepared
- `shipped` - Order shipped
- `delivered` - Order delivered

## Notification Types

| Type | Description | Priority | Recipients |
|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| `group_join_request` | User wants to join group | normal | Group owner |
| `group_filled` | Group reached capacity | high | Group owner |
| `payment_completed` | Payment successful | normal | Payer |
| `payment_received` | Payment received | normal | Group owner |
| `product_delivered` | Product delivered | normal | User |
| `discount_expired` | Discount period ended | high | All participants |
| `payment_deadline_expired` | Payment deadline passed | urgent | Unpaid users |
| `order_status_change` | Order status updated | normal | User |

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Database Setup

The system uses the existing `sellerNotifications` table. No additional setup required.

### 2. Cron Job Setup

For production, set up a cron job to process expired notifications:

```bash
# Run every hour
0 * * * * curl -X POST http://your-domain.com/api/notifications/process-expired

# Or run daily at 9 AM
0 9 * * * curl -X POST http://your-domain.com/api/notifications/process-expired
```

### 3. Manual Processing

You can also process expired notifications manually:

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/notifications/process-expired

# Via script
cd server && npx tsx cronJobs.ts
```

## Frontend Integration

The existing `SellerNotifications` component already supports:
- Real-time notification display
- Unread count badges
- Mark as read functionality
- Notification management

The component automatically refreshes every 30 seconds to show new notifications.

## Testing

### Test Notifications

Create test notifications using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/seller/notifications/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "type": "test",
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "message": "This is a test notification"
  }'
```

### Test Scenarios

1. **S1**: Join a group and check group owner's notifications
2. **S2**: Approve participants until group is full
3. **S3**: Complete a payment and check notifications
4. **S4**: Update order status to "delivered"
5. **S5**: Set group `offerValidTill` to past date and run cron job
6. **S6**: Set payment deadline to past date and run cron job

## Error Handling

The notification system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Graceful failure if notification creation fails
- Logging of all notification attempts
- Fallback mechanisms for missing data
- Non-blocking notification processing

## Performance Considerations

- Notifications are created asynchronously
- Batch processing for expired notifications
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Minimal impact on main application flow

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the notification system:

1. **Email Notifications**: Integrate with email service
2. **SMS Notifications**: Add SMS support for urgent notifications
3. **Push Notifications**: Browser push notifications
4. **Notification Preferences**: User-configurable notification settings
5. **Notification Templates**: Customizable message templates
6. **Analytics**: Notification delivery and engagement tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications not appearing**: Check if user is authenticated and has proper permissions
2. **Expired notifications not processing**: Ensure cron job is running or call API manually
3. **Missing notification data**: Verify all required data is available in the database

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by checking console output for notification-related messages.

## Conclusion

- ‚úÖ Real-time notifications via email, in-app messages
- ‚úÖ Relevant details (group name, product info, payment amount, deadlines)
- ‚úÖ Updated shipping status tracking
