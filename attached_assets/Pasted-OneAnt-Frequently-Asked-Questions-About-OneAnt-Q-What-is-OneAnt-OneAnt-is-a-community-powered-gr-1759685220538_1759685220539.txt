OneAnt ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions
About OneAnt
Q: What is OneAnt?‚Ä®OneAnt is a community-powered grocery platform where you shop together to save more. By joining or creating groups, you unlock bulk discounts (typically 8-10%) on everyday groceries from trusted local sellers.
Q: Why ‚ÄúOneAnt‚Äù?‚Ä®Ants thrive together, sharing resources, working as a team, and multiplying their strength. That‚Äôs exactly what OneAnt brings to grocery shopping: collective power, bigger savings, and less waste.

Shopping & Deals
Q: How do I find deals?‚Ä®Browse the OneAnt app or website. You‚Äôll see fresh produce, pantry staples, and local favorites at exclusive group prices. Add what you love to your cart, then share it to start or join a group.
Q: What makes OneAnt cheaper than regular grocery shopping?‚Ä®Our discounts come from collective buying. When enough people commit to the same deal within 24 hours, sellers can offer wholesale-like prices. Everyone saves without compromising on quality.
Q: Are products fresh and authentic?‚Ä®Yes! We partner directly with trusted local sellers and small businesses. This means fresher goods, better traceability, and your dollars staying within the community.

Groups & Sharing
Q: How do I join a group?‚Ä®Simple. When someone shares a link with you, click it, view the deal, and join with one click. Complete your payment, and once the group fills, your order is confirmed.
Q: What if I don‚Äôt have friends to share with?‚Ä®No worries. You can join an existing open group on the platform. OneAnt connects you to other shoppers in your community so you never miss out.
Q: What happens if the group doesn‚Äôt fill in 24 hours?‚Ä®If the minimum number of people isn‚Äôt reached, your payment is released back to you automatically. No risk, no hidden costs.
‚Ä®Delivery & Pick-Up
Q: How does delivery work?‚Ä®You get two options:
Group Delivery (Extra 10% off): All orders in your group are sent to a single address (like an apartment lobby, or a friend‚Äôs house). This reduces costs and cuts carbon emissions.
Individual Delivery: If you prefer doorstep delivery, you can choose that too (no extra discount, but maximum convenience).
Q: Can I pick up my order?‚Ä®Yes, we offer pick-up option at hub location.
‚Ä®Payments & Refunds
Q: When is my card charged?‚Ä®Your payment is captured when you confirm your order, but it only goes through if your group fills within 24 hours. If not, the amount is refunded.
Q: How are refunds processed?‚Ä®Refunds are automatic and usually reflect back in your bank within 3‚Äì5 business days.
Q: Is my payment secure?‚Ä®Yes. We use trusted, PCI-compliant payment gateways to ensure your data and transactions are safe.
‚Ä®Impact & Community
Q: How does OneAnt reduce carbon footprints?‚Ä®By encouraging group deliveries and consolidated orders, fewer delivery trips are made. That means less fuel, fewer trucks on the road, and lower emissions.
Q: Does shopping on OneAnt support local businesses?‚Ä®Absolutely. We partner with local sellers, farms, and independent stores. Every order you place helps strengthen small businesses in your community.

Q: Do I need to download an app?‚Ä®Not necessarily. You can shop directly from our website or use our mobile app (coming soon).
